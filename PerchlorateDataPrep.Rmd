Wells within Â½-mile of detections likely to get detections once DLR is dropped from 4ppb to 2ppb. MCL is 6ppb. 

Do circles around detections (>4ppb) and ID possible wells that could get detections.

Lets play with the data.

```{r}
#plot data
  ggplot(aes(x=mean_finding),data=Complete)+
  geom_histogram (binwidth=0.5) +
    coord_cartesian(
      xlim=c(0,10)
    )
#notice the discreteness at 0 (sometimes reported by labs) and 4 (actual DLR)
#let's zoom in on what's important 
  ggplot(aes(x=mean_finding),data=Complete)+
  geom_histogram (binwidth=0.5) +
        scale_fill_gradient(low= "red",
                        high="yellow") +
    scale_x_continuous(limits=c(5,112))
  
#are there correlations with filtration status or water type code?
Complete %>%
  drop_na(Filtration.Status) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= Filtration.Status,y= mean_finding))+
    geom_boxplot()
#bad metadata

Complete %>%
  drop_na(Water.Type.Code) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= Water.Type.Code,y= mean_finding))+
    geom_boxplot()

#not sure what "blank" or "GU" means on WaterTypeCode, but it seems like most of the contaminated water is in the groundwater group. 

```

Extra stuff

```{r}
#Define new binary qualifier for "system name" containing the word "School"
PerchlorateSummPSCodeNA_join$school <- ifelse(grepl("SCHOOL",PerchlorateSummPSCodeNA_join$System), 1, 0)
#school gets marked as "1", if not, 0

#count the number of school systems
summarize(PerchlorateSummPSCodeNA_join,
          schools = sum(school))
#635

#split the data into just what we need to join it back in ArcGis

keeps <- c("school", "System")
schoolsPSCode <- PerchlorateSummPSCodeNA_join[keeps]

```

```{r}
#write
write.csv(schoolsPSCode, "C:\\Users\\SCoffin\\ArcGIS\\ArcGIS\\Perchlorate\\schools_PSCODE.csv")
